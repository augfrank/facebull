 This contains the code, research papers and the test cases used to solve Facebull.
 This was a fun project that I did in 2009 over a period of 6 months. 

 Facebull was the hardest of all the puzzles present in the original career section of 
 Facebook.com. The section has since been replaced with interviewstreet's tool.

 First I modeled this problem incorrectly[1]. Then, I defined it more accurately[2]. An 
 accurate definition of this problem helped me solve it.
